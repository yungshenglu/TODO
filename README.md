# Vue Simple TodoList

This reposiotory is my practice to implement a simple TODO-list in Vue/Vuex.

## Execution

1. Project setup
    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```
2. Compiles and hot-reloads for development
    ```bash
    $ npm run serve
    ```
3. Compiles and minifies for production
    ```bash
    $ npm run build
    ```
4. Lints and fixes files
    ```bash
    $ npm run lint
    ```

> See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Implementation

#### Prerequisite

1. Make sure you have already install Node.js
2. Install Vue-CLI for initializing the project
    ```bash
    $ npm install -g "@vue/cli"

3. Create a Vue project via Vue-CLI
    ```bash
    $ vue create vue-todolist
    # You will need to do some settings below if succeed
    Vue CLI v4.2.3

    ? Check the feautures needed for your projects: TS, Vuex, CSS Pre-processors, Linter
    ? Use class-style component syntax? Yes

    ? Pick a CSS pre-processor? Sass/SCSS (with dart-sass)
    ? Pick a linter / formatter config: TSLint

    ```
    * This will take a while for initializing the project
    * You will get the following message if initialized succeed.
        ```bash
        ðŸŽ‰  Successfully created project todolist.
        ðŸ‘‰  Get started with the following commands:

        $ cd todolist
        $ npm run serve

        ```
4. Change directory to your project and show all files
    ```bash
    $ cd vue-todolist/ & ls
    README.md         package-lock.json public            tsconfig.json
